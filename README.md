**Gradient Descent Animation**

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Gradient Descent algorithm**, paired with an animated 3D visualization that demonstrates the convergence process. The code allows users to visualize how the algorithm optimizes a function step by step, adjusting parameters like the learning rate and initial values.

The animation is designed to show the movement of the gradient descent trajectory in real-time, helping users better understand the optimization process. Itâ€™s an educational tool ideal for those learning machine learning or optimization algorithms, offering insights into the dynamics of gradient-based methods.

Key features of the repository:
- Customizable parameters for the learning rate, initial starting point, and the number of iterations.
- 3D visualization of the gradient descent process, showing the movement towards the minimum of a function.
- Easy to modify for different optimization problems or to experiment with different mathematical functions.

Clone the repository, customize the settings, and watch the gradient descent algorithm in action! The code is modular and can be easily adapted for other optimization tasks or learning rate adjustments.

Feel free to fork, modify, and contribute!
